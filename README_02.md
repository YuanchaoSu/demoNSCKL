# demo_NSCKL
A demo of NSCKL can also be available from Github. But this demo only uploads the Indian Pines data because the sizes of others exceed the Github limit.
Another demo of NSCKL can also be available from the Baidu cloud disk, and it includes four hyperspectral data, including Indian Pines, Salinas, Houston University, and WHU-Hi data.
Since cloud disk can support big data, these common data are added into the Baidu cloud demo.
